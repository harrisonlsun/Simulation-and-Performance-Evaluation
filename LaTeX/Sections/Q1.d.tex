\textbf{(d) What proportion of jobs were delayed and how does the proportion related to the utilization?\\\\}
72\% of jobs were delayed. This is related to the utilization in that having jobs waiting to start after the previous job is completed increases the utilization because there is no time in between where the server is idle. However, the proportion of jobs that are delayed is not necessarily proportional to the utilization, as the service time of the jobs may differ. That said, as the proportion of the jobs that are delayed approaches 100\%, the utilization tends to 100\%.
